This Power BI project was completed as part of my Data Analytics certification. The objective was to analyze and visualize employee salary data to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) and workforce trends. I cleaned and transformed the dataset using Power Query, created calculated columns, and built an interactive dashboard featuring KPIs such as average salary by department, top job titles by compensation, and employee distribution. The dashboard includes slicers for dynamic filtering and visual storytelling, enabling users to explore salary trends, departmental structures, and hiring patterns.
